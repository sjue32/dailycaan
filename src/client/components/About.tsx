        {/* insert photo */}
        <p>In the Chinese dialect, Cantonese, the word "chaan" means meal. Not only within Chinese culture,
          but all around the world, eating is not only a means of sustenance, but also a source of delight
          and pleasure. It's something we look forward to at least 3, if not 4, or more time a day (snacks, desserts,
          and drinks included). As it is, there seems to be a web app for everything, however we could always
          benefit from more sharing, especially of our "daily chaans."
        </p><br></br>
        <p>Please enjoy as we continue to ramp up the service.</p>
